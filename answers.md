# Answers for Github Basics
I learned that there is a difference between forks and branches, although I am still a little bit confused as to when use both. 
From my understanding you **branch on your own** projects and you **fork** if you are **working on someone elses**, but I am not sure if there is more to it than that so I will look more into this to learn more.

I did spend a few minutes confused because I was attempting to create a pull request to work on this exercise and I didn't know quite where to go as my screen looked different to what I was seeing on the guide.
After looking back at the first days lecture slides however I realized it automatically makes the pull request for me and that I don't manually have to do anything (outside of accepting the exercise that is).

We did use Git and Github for COSC 2030 last semester, but I am realizing there is a lot more to these tools that just 'git add/commit/push' so I definetly think doing some more research on my own to get a better
idea of what everything actually does as this will help me understand how to navigate these tools much easier.
